# ecl-win-vs11-example

Based on http://vwood.github.io/embedded-ecl.html
so, essentially, copy pasted the code and foo'ed around with 
project settings my ECL is installed under C:\ecl\13.5.1\
This folder must be in the PATH (for ecl.dll)

... and fixed an error :P

The juice is on [EclEmbeddingTest.cpp](https://github.com/fabriceleal/ecl-win-vs11-example/blob/master/EclEmbeddingTest/EclEmbeddingTest.cpp)

# ecl-win-vs11-example

Based on http://vwood.github.io/embedded-ecl.html
so, essentially, copy pasted the code and foo'ed around with 
project settings until it worked.
My ECL is installed under C:\ecl\13.5.1\
This folder must be in the PATH (it needs ecl.dll)

... and fixed an error (check the function void init())

The juice is on [EclEmbeddingTest.cpp](https://github.com/fabriceleal/ecl-win-vs11-example/blob/master/EclEmbeddingTest/EclEmbeddingTest.cpp)
